    <h5>Hey!<br/><br/> I'm not really certain what I want to write about, but figured I would treat this like a writing exercise where I'm free to express my thoughts.  I don't exactly
    have defined plans for this blog space and that's still alright.  I haven't been learning much code lately; I learned some JS towards the beginning of June, but have focused my energy
    on other areas of life as I'm able to see friends and become a more social person after being vaccinated.  There are two things that I'd like to accomplish with this site, and I'm not
    really certain which will be more challenging.  First off - I want to have a searchable, taggable photo gallery that friends and family can search, add to, and completely utilize - that
    hasn't changed.  Second off - I want to add a section about my music interests to this site, I'm completely certain of this. <br/><br/>I know that the Spotify API is fairly
    straightforward to work with, but I've never worked with an API before and the notion is kind of daunting.  It feels easier to just keep learning through my structured course that kind of
    bores me.  I'm sure there are helpful YouTube videos out there that could help me learn how to use this API.. I think I'll look into this.<br/><br/>I did a bit of research into making 
    images searchable and taggable, asked some friends, noticed some reddit posts, and learned that this will likely take a great deal of work. The first problem that I noticed is how
    I would need to make some form of login system so that strangers wouldn't have unbelievably easy access to images of me and my pals.  I don't see this being a huge issue, but I know that
    I need to learn how to make this, and I imagine this requires some back end knowledge in order to store user credentials and assorted user data.  The second issue with this is the sheer 
    amount of work I anticipate it takes to manually tag thousands of photos.  Ideally, these photos will be searchable by as many fields as people might want: name, date, occasion, etc.
    I'd like to make these photos face-taggable too, but I think that will take more knowedge than I'm prepared to take in at the moment.<br/><br/>Other than website stuff,
    I've really been enjoying spending time with my close friends and meeting new people.  Being shut in for so long helped me realise how important other people are to my mental health, 
    and how great of an experience getting to know others, seeing the good in others, can be.  I don't really know what I feel comfortable just sharing online to anyone, but I suppose I'll 
    subconsciously adjust that filter.  I've been reading a bit recently, and have enjoyed some books that my pal has sent my way.  These seem to be another means for me to enjoy
    others' tales and perspectives, more leisurely than with other real people.  I decorated a mirror with sharpie and look forward to adding fun designs to it as I feel the urge.
    I got some new running shoes which have shown greater support for my ankle than my previous pair of shoes.  I actually shaved my legs for the first time, too.  I completely
    botched it and had really itchy legs for a few days.  I haven't needed shaving cream for my face since I was a teenager, so I assumed that the same would be true for my
    legs; I was wrong.  I've been going on some dates through the Hinge dating app and have been really enjoying that - it's a nice way to get some new music in my life at a minimum.
    I think that's all I have to say for now.  Thanks for reading.<br/><br/>- Jake</h5>
