    <h1>June 1, 2021</h1>
    <br/><br/>

    <h6>Hey!<br/><br/> My name is Jake Coppola, and welcome to my website!  This is my first blog post, and while this post is fairly free-form, I don't expect <em>all</em> posts here to 
    hold similar form.  I would like to add tags to help readers sort by topics, styles of posts, and maybe even more!  That being said, I'll need to learn how to do that before it 
    actually happens.  This space will initiall serve as a means for me to document what I'm learning, especially what I'm learning about coding. <br/><br/>Up until this point, I 
    have learned about Python through Al Sweigart's course, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python," HTML and CSS through the courses "Internetting is Hard" and "The Complete Web 
    Developer," and some Javascript through "The Complete Web Developer."  I'm loving all that I'm learning, and hope to turn this site into a place where I can share photos, 
    recipes, projects, and more with my close friends and family.  I'd also love to post completed projects of mine here as I finish them; those will come in due time.  For now, 
    I'll likely post about what I'm learning, and try to use what I'm learning to create interesting content about other instersts of mine.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! -Jake</h6>
